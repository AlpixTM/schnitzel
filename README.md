# Schnitzel (jagd)

Learn the Linux console with a small game. The name is inspired by the German term for a paper chase "Schnitzeljagd". The exercises are in German, so it is not directly usable for English speakers.

## Prerequisites

The game is based on Ruby and requires at least Ruby 2.4 to run. No additional Gems required.

## Platform

The game was tested on

  * Ubuntu 19.04
  * Ubuntu 18.04
  * MacOS 10.14 (Mojave)

## Acknowledgement

This program is based on the idea of Eugen Krizki and Richard Vladimirskij and their framework [pepio](https://github.com/limecakeio/pepio). Due to the many dependencies and problems with the node.js based pepio, I decided to do a complete re-implementation and extension in Ruby. The goal was to have one single file which can be downloaded and executed easily.
